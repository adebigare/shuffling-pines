# Shuffling Pines
## What is this?
This simple Angular app is utilitarian in nature, and allows a user to input "guests" for a hypothetical nursing home. Once entered, the user may edit their status or delete the user. 

## Getting up and running 

This app is written in javascript and runs on a combination of Node packages (managed by node package manager), with bower dependency management. 

It uses Jasmine and Karma for unit testing, Bootstrap for UI, Gulp for the build system, and Angular and JQuery to support the javascript development. 

###Installing

These instructions assume that the user has already downloaded bower, node.js, and node package manager.  

- Open a terminal window
- Navigate to the enclosing folder this project will reside within
- Type:
npm install
bower install 
gulp (will start the server, run unit tests and concatenate files)

The application will be running at http://localhost:8080
